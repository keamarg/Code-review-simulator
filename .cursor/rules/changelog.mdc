## Changelog Management
- Maintain or update a CHANGELOG.md file after each completed task.
- Create CHANGELOG.md if it does not exist.
- **ALWAYS get the current date** before updating changelog entries by running: `date +"%Y-%m-%d"`
- Use the actual system date returned from the command, never assume or use outdated dates
- Follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 with this structure:

    - [MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] - YYYY-MM-DD
 - Increment the version based on change type:
    - MAJOR for breaking changes
    - MINOR for new features
    - PATCH for bug fixes or small improvements
