## Development Environment
- Use Cursor's integrated terminal panel for all command suggestions
- When npm run start is already running in one terminal tab, suggest opening a new terminal tab (+ button in terminal panel) for additional commands or restart the running session if it is necesarry
- Always assume commands will be executed in the integrated terminal unless otherwise specified
