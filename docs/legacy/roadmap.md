# Roadmap

## Features
- Let the student see the task they are working on - Prio 1
- Model questions should be more diverse - Prio 1

- Other approaches. If a students is stuck. Either ask a new question or try another approach - Prio 2. Kan vi skrive det ind i prompten?
- Model grading should be improved. Something like only the elements examined should be graded. Not all learning goals. Den grader ret hårdt
- Deploye. Sende keys op først
- Hvorfor var modellen langsom sidst?

## Questions
- Can teachers actually create an exam?
- How are students using the tool?

## Forståelse
- Websockets
- Hvordan virker multimodal-live-client?

## Nice to have
- At man kan se den feedback man får
- At man kan se den karakter man får
- At man kan se for hver session man har haft feedback of karakter

## Done
- Model should be more strict. Den opdager ikke at syntaksen er helt forkert. Den er for hjælpsom og venlig. - Prio 1

## Logo

- Interacting Bubbles (Human & AI): Two overlapping or adjacent speech bubbles. One is a standard, soft-cornered bubble (representing the student). The other is slightly more geometric or has a subtle tech pattern (like lines or dots) inside (representing the AI). This highlights the dialogue/interaction at the core. Style: Conversational, modern, relationship-focused (student-AI).
- Stylized Screen & Checkmark: Similar to the MobilePay phone, use a simplified rectangle with rounded corners to represent a screen. Inside or overlapping the screen, place a bold, clear checkmark (✓). This focuses on the successful completion of the exam via a digital interface. A subtle AI element (like a small cog or circuit dot) could be integrated into the checkmark or screen corner. Style: Modern, results-oriented, digital.
- Noget med det der AI symbol man begynder at se overalt
- Question Mark & AI Node: A large, stylized question mark (representing the exam/questions). At the dot of the question mark, place a glowing circle or a simple circuit node icon, symbolizing the AI powering the examination process. Style: Minimalist, questioning/exam focus, subtle tech.
- Graduation scroll
- Maybe kind of a chat interface where to the left a profile of a person has a chat bubble just saying a green line. To the right an AI sparkle is saying checkmark. In the bottom of the logo is a green stamp that says "passed"

## Bugs
- Examinertype is not working
