# Legacy WebSocket Cleanup - Code Review Simulator

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive cleanup performed to migrate from the legacy WebSocket implementation to the new GenAI Live Client, which resolved critical errors including "WebSocket is not connected" when pressing stop.

## Issues Resolved

### Primary Problems

- **WebSocket Connection Error**: `WebSocket is not connected` error from `MultimodalLiveClient._sendDirect`
- **Timer Issues**: Countdown timer not starting properly when exam began
- **Voice Instructions**: AI not receiving system instructions due to client mismatch
- **Mixed Client Usage**: Application using both legacy and new client implementations simultaneously

### Root Cause

The application was still using the legacy `useLiveAPIContext` and `LiveAPIProvider` in key components while the new GenAI Live Client was available but not fully implemented.

## Migration Performed

### Components Updated

#### 1. ControlTrayCustom.tsx

- **Before**: Used `useLiveAPIContext` with legacy WebSocket client
- **After**: Migrated to `useGenAILiveContext` with new GenAI Live Client
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed direct `connect()` calls from button handler
  - Updated to notify parent component for connection management
  - Fixed disconnect functionality to work with new client

#### 2. CodeReviewWorkflow.impl.tsx

- **Before**: Used `useLiveAPIContext` with `setConfig` and `config` properties
- **After**: Migrated to `useGenAILiveContext` with local config management
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added local `liveConfig` state to replace removed `config` property
  - Updated `connect()` calls to pass model and config parameters
  - Fixed dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

#### 3. CodeReviewPage.tsx

- **Before**: Used `LiveAPIProvider` wrapper and duplicate PageContent component
- **After**: Migrated to `GenAILiveProvider` with simplified structure
- **Key Changes**:
  - Replaced `LiveAPIProvider` with `GenAILiveProvider`
  - Consolidated screen share notification logic
  - Removed duplicate PageContent component
  - Added required `apiKey` prop to provider

### Code Cleanup

#### Removed Components

- `PageContent` component and `PageContentProps` interface (duplicate functionality)
- Legacy WebSocket URI constants
- Unused imports: `ReactMarkdown`, `webcam`, `connect` variables

#### Updated Imports

- `useLiveAPIContext` â†’ `useGenAILiveContext`
- `LiveAPIProvider` â†’ `GenAILiveProvider`
- Fixed Layout component import path

## Results

### âœ… Fixed Issues

- **WebSocket Errors**: Completely eliminated "WebSocket is not connected" errors
- **Timer Functionality**: Countdown timer now starts and pauses correctly
- **Voice Instructions**: AI properly receives system instructions and responds appropriately
- **Connection Management**: Pause/stop functionality works reliably
- **Build Success**: Application builds without WebSocket-related errors

### ðŸ”§ Remaining Warnings

- Minor ESLint warnings for unused variables (non-critical)
- Hook dependency warnings (non-blocking)
- Template string expression warnings (cosmetic)

## Technical Benefits

1. **Single Client Implementation**: Unified on the new GenAI Live Client
2. **Better Error Handling**: Improved connection state management
3. **Session Resumption**: Automatic reconnection with handles for continuity
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging capabilities
5. **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and resource management

## Verification

### Build Status

```bash
npm run build
# âœ… Builds successfully with only minor linting warnings
# âœ… No WebSocket connection errors
# âœ… File size: 210.55 kB (minimal increase from cleanup)
```

### Key Functionality Tested

- âœ… Start button initiates connection and timer
- âœ… Pause button stops voice and timer immediately
- âœ… Resume functionality works without permission errors
- âœ… Screen sharing notifications work properly
- âœ… AI receives and responds to instructions

## Conclusion

The legacy WebSocket cleanup was successful and has significantly improved the reliability and functionality of the Code Review Simulator. The application now uses a consistent, modern client implementation throughout, resolving all connection-related issues that were affecting the user experience.

All critical functionality has been preserved while eliminating the technical debt from the mixed client implementation approach.
