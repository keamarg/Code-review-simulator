## [0.17.39] - 2025-06-30

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Multiple Force Stop Audio Calls**: Fixed issue where force stop audio was being called 4-5 times during session cleanup causing excessive logging and potential performance issues

  - **Root Cause**: The `forceStopAudio` useEffect had unstable dependencies (`audioDataHandler` and `audioVolumeHandler`) that were recreated on every render, causing the effect to run multiple times
  - **Solution**: Used `useCallback` to make handler functions stable and added `forceStopInProgressRef` guard to prevent duplicate calls
  - **Impact**: Eliminates console log spam showing "üéõÔ∏è ControlTray: Force stopping audio recording..." appearing 4-5 times
  - **Performance**: Reduces redundant audio cleanup operations during session termination
  - **Clean Logs**: Force stop now runs only once per session end instead of multiple times

- **Audio Worklet Console Spam**: Reduced excessive console logging from audio worklet after recording stops

  - **Root Cause**: Audio worklet continues sending data for a brief period after recording is stopped, causing 15+ identical log messages
  - **Solution**: Added `hasLoggedIgnoring` flag to only log the worklet data ignoring message once per session
  - **Impact**: Eliminates repetitive "üé§ AudioRecorder: Worklet received data but recording is false, ignoring" messages
  - **Clean Console**: Only one informative message about suppressing further worklet messages
  - **Better Debugging**: Console remains readable without being flooded with expected worklet cleanup messages

- **Multiple Auto-Trigger Calls**: Fixed issue where auto-trigger mechanism was being called multiple times during connection state changes

  - **Root Cause**: `onButtonReady` effect in ControlTray was resetting notification flag during connection state changes, allowing multiple auto-trigger calls
  - **Solution**: Removed notification flag reset during connection state changes, letting parent component handle auto-trigger prevention
  - **Impact**: Eliminates "üö´ Auto-trigger already completed - ignoring subsequent calls" spam messages
  - **Clean Flow**: Auto-trigger now only happens once per session as intended
  - **Better State Management**: Parent component (AIExaminerPage) properly manages auto-trigger lifecycle

### Enhanced

- **Audio Handler Stability**: Improved audio recording cleanup reliability

  - **Stable Dependencies**: Using `useCallback` for `audioDataHandler` and `audioVolumeHandler` prevents unnecessary effect re-runs
  - **Cleanup Guards**: Added proper guards to prevent duplicate cleanup operations
  - **Session Isolation**: Each recording session now has proper state isolation and cleanup
  - **Memory Management**: Reduced memory pressure from recreated handler functions on every render

- **Browser Compatibility Notice**: Added clear browser requirement information on landing page
  - **User Guidance**: Added notice under Quick Start button stating "Google Chrome required for screen sharing and microphone access"
  - **Better UX**: Users now know browser requirements before attempting to start a review
  - **Visual Design**: Used info icon and subtle styling to provide helpful context without being intrusive
  - **Prevents Frustration**: Helps users avoid failed attempts with unsupported browsers (Safari, Firefox)

### Clarified

- **Automatic Reconnection Skip Messages**: Clarified that "üö´ Automatic reconnection skipped" messages are normal and expected behavior

  - **WebSocket Error 1007**: When WebSocket closes with error 1007 ("Request contains an invalid argument"), the system correctly skips reconnection
  - **Expected Behavior**: Only WebSocket error 1011 triggers automatic reconnection; all other errors are handled by skipping reconnection
  - **No Action Required**: These messages indicate the system is working correctly and preventing inappropriate reconnection attempts
  - **Debugging Aid**: The detailed skip reasons help developers understand why reconnection was not attempted

## [0.17.34] - 2025-06-26

  - **Solution**: Added introduction timer setup for quick start sessions even when duration is 0
  - **Result**: AI now introduces itself immediately in quick start sessions like in regular reviews
  - **Timer Logic**: Quick start sessions get introduction timer only, while timed sessions get full timer suite

- **Double Screen Sharing Dialog**: Fixed screen sharing permission dialog appearing twice after review ends

  - **Root Cause**: Auto-trigger mechanism was being called multiple times during state transitions when `connected` changed from `true` to `false`
  - **Solution**: Added tracking flags to prevent multiple auto-trigger calls during the same session
  - **hasAutoTriggeredRef**: Prevents auto-trigger from being called more than once per session
  - **hasNotifiedButtonReadyRef**: Prevents onButtonReady from being called multiple times during state transitions

  - **Button State Logic**: Added `!buttonIsOn` condition to prevent triggering when button is already active

- **AI Voice Restarting After Review**: Fixed issue where AI would start a new review automatically after the previous review ended
  - **Root Cause**: Auto-trigger mechanism was being reactivated when `connected` changed from `true` to `false` after review ended
  - **Solution**: Made auto-trigger a one-time-only mechanism that permanently disables after any review starts
  - **Permanent Disable**: Once `examIntentStarted` becomes true, auto-trigger is permanently disabled for the session
  - **Initial Load Only**: Auto-trigger now only works on the initial page load, not after reviews end

  - **Result**: Resume now has minimal delay and AI responds quickly to speech input without WebSocket or worklet errors
  - **Performance**: Eliminated ~100-200ms delay caused by AudioContext recreation and worklet re-registration

## [0.17.18] - 2025-06-23

### Fixed

- **Resume Delays**: Fixed massive delays that occurred immediately after resume by reverting excessive WebSocket state checking
  - **Root Cause**: Added extensive WebSocket state validation in `sendRealtimeInput`, `sendToolResponse`, and `send` methods that was causing performance issues
  - **Solution**: Reverted to original simple approach with only basic null checks for session
  - **Performance Impact**: Removed redundant connection status checks, disconnecting flags, and try-catch blocks that were slowing down data transmission
  - **Video Frame Sending**: Removed connection check from video frame sending that was also causing delays
  - **Result**: Resume now works as fast as it did before the WebSocket state checking was added
  - **Maintained Safety**: Kept simple null checks to prevent errors while removing performance-killing validation

## [0.17.17] - 2025-06-23

## [0.16.1] - 2025-06-02

### Fixed

- Resolved critical styling issues in the live suggestions popup window:
  - Ensured consistent application of margins and padding for suggestion items by using `setAttribute('style', ...)` instead of relying solely on React's `style` prop for portaled components, fixing spacing and scrolling problems.
  - Re-enabled stylesheet copying from the main application to the popup, allowing CSS variables and global styles to function correctly within the popup.
  - Verified that theme-consistent styling (backgrounds, text colors, shadows, hover effects) applies correctly to all suggestion items and panel elements within the popup.
- Removed diagnostic code (manual test divs and temporary style overrides) from `PopupWindow.tsx` and `LiveSuggestionsPanel.tsx`.

### Changed

- Refactored `LiveSuggestionsPanel.tsx` to use a helper component `SuggestionItem` and a `toStyleString` utility for more robust style application via `setAttribute`.
- Adjusted padding within the live suggestions panel for better layout.

## [0.16.2] - 2025-06-02

### Fixed

  - **Root Cause**: The first useEffect had `prompt` in its dependency array, creating a loop where `prepareExamContent()` ‚Üí `setPrompt()` ‚Üí useEffect triggers again ‚Üí `prepareExamContent()` runs again
  - **Solution**: Removed `prompt` and `isLoadingPrompt` from the dependency array and added conditions `!prompt && !isLoadingPrompt` to prevent duplicate calls
  - **Impact**: Eliminates duplicate console messages like "üöÄ Preparing quick start general review" appearing twice
  - **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary processing and API calls during exam initialization
  - **Clean Logs**: Console now shows each preparation step only once instead of multiple times

## [0.17.39] - 2025-06-30

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: Multiple Force Stop Audio Calls**: Fixed issue where force stop audio was being called 4-5 times during session cleanup causing excessive logging and potential performance issues

  - **Root Cause**: The `forceStopAudio` useEffect had unstable dependencies (`audioDataHandler` and `audioVolumeHandler`) that were recreated on every render, causing the effect to run multiple times
  - **Solution**: Used `useCallback` to make handler functions stable and added `forceStopInProgressRef` guard to prevent duplicate calls
  - **Impact**: Eliminates console log spam showing "üéõÔ∏è ControlTray: Force stopping audio recording..." appearing 4-5 times
  - **Performance**: Reduces redundant audio cleanup operations during session termination
  - **Clean Logs**: Force stop now runs only once per session end instead of multiple times

- **Audio Worklet Console Spam**: Reduced excessive console logging from audio worklet after recording stops

  - **Root Cause**: Audio worklet continues sending data for a brief period after recording is stopped, causing 15+ identical log messages
  - **Solution**: Added `hasLoggedIgnoring` flag to only log the worklet data ignoring message once per session
  - **Impact**: Eliminates repetitive "üé§ AudioRecorder: Worklet received data but recording is false, ignoring" messages
  - **Clean Console**: Only one informative message about suppressing further worklet messages
  - **Better Debugging**: Console remains readable without being flooded with expected worklet cleanup messages

- **Multiple Auto-Trigger Calls**: Fixed issue where auto-trigger mechanism was being called multiple times during connection state changes

  - **Root Cause**: `onButtonReady` effect in ControlTray was resetting notification flag during connection state changes, allowing multiple auto-trigger calls
  - **Solution**: Removed notification flag reset during connection state changes, letting parent component handle auto-trigger prevention
  - **Impact**: Eliminates "üö´ Auto-trigger already completed - ignoring subsequent calls" spam messages
  - **Clean Flow**: Auto-trigger now only happens once per session as intended
  - **Better State Management**: Parent component (AIExaminerPage) properly manages auto-trigger lifecycle

### Enhanced

- **Audio Handler Stability**: Improved audio recording cleanup reliability

  - **Stable Dependencies**: Using `useCallback` for `audioDataHandler` and `audioVolumeHandler` prevents unnecessary effect re-runs
  - **Cleanup Guards**: Added proper guards to prevent duplicate cleanup operations
  - **Session Isolation**: Each recording session now has proper state isolation and cleanup
  - **Memory Management**: Reduced memory pressure from recreated handler functions on every render

- **Browser Compatibility Notice**: Added clear browser requirement information on landing page
  - **User Guidance**: Added notice under Quick Start button stating "Google Chrome required for screen sharing and microphone access"
  - **Better UX**: Users now know browser requirements before attempting to start a review
  - **Visual Design**: Used info icon and subtle styling to provide helpful context without being intrusive
  - **Prevents Frustration**: Helps users avoid failed attempts with unsupported browsers (Safari, Firefox)

### Clarified

- **Automatic Reconnection Skip Messages**: Clarified that "üö´ Automatic reconnection skipped" messages are normal and expected behavior

  - **WebSocket Error 1007**: When WebSocket closes with error 1007 ("Request contains an invalid argument"), the system correctly skips reconnection
  - **Expected Behavior**: Only WebSocket error 1011 triggers automatic reconnection; all other errors are handled by skipping reconnection
  - **No Action Required**: These messages indicate the system is working correctly and preventing inappropriate reconnection attempts
  - **Debugging Aid**: The detailed skip reasons help developers understand why reconnection was not attempted
